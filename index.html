<h2>What I Want</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a company with a fanatical devotion to being awesome.  I want to work for a company that wants to do great things and do them incredibly well.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What I Offer</h2>

<h4>Excellent problem solving and trouble shooting skills.</h4>

<p>In my first tech job as a consultant, I was responsible for developing effective solutions for clients to get their business back up and running as quickly as possible. Usually this meant going into a company I&rsquo;d never been in, talking to people I&rsquo;d never met, and working on systems I&rsquo;d never seen and then making everything come out good, fast, and cheap (because no one likes having to pick just two).</p>

<h4>Excitement for trying new things.</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s very rare to find me not tinkering with some new gadget, tech, or tool. That passion is what helps me get more done than someone who feels it&rsquo;s just another job.</p>

<h4>Programming knowledge.</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming as a hobby since I was a teenager (TI-86 BASIC). My knowledge of Ruby, Python, Obj-C, and other languages keeps me from having to do the same thing over and over again and keeps me from being bored because there&rsquo;s an endless supply of things to learn.</p>

<h4>Extensive software knowledge.</h4>

<p>I have used or set up numerous different configurations in my professional career including Microsoft Dynamics GP, MISYS, Quickbooks, Microsoft Office, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Asterisk, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, Tomcat, and many others. I&rsquo;ve experimented with even more where I haven&rsquo;t yet had a need or chance to implement them in a professionally.</p>

<h4>Excellent communication skills</h4>

<p>Often what people are asking for and what they&rsquo;re saying are two very different things (especially in tech). My years of experience as both a sysadmin and a consultant have heightened my ability to figure out what people are <em>really</em> asking for.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>LeapFILE/Oxygen Cloud</h3>

I came out in July of 2010 for a mid-level Technical Support position and used my sysadmin experience to work my way into an operations position.</p>

<ul>
<li>Handle end-user product support for LeapFILE product while migrating legacy LeapFILE system to upgraded servers.</li>
<li>Increase performance and system reliability by setting up Apache&rsquo;s mod_proxy_ajp to load balance between Tomcat backends.</li>
<li>Setup monitoring and alerting using Cacti and Nagios.</li>
<li>Use Chef to automate deployment and configuration setup for new Oxygen Cloud architecture.</li>
<li>Write web based user signup process for Oxygen Cloud using Padrino (prototyped in Sinatra). Thrift APIs are used to communicate to the Java (Tomcat) backend.</li>

<h3>Pressure-Pro, Inc</h3>

<p>IT/IS Administrator >> CTO<br/>
Fort Pierce, FL<br/>
July 2006 &ndash; June 2010</p>
