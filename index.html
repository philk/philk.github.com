<h2>What I Want</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a company with a fanatical devotion to being awesome.  I want to work for a company that wants to do great things and do them incredibly well.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What I Offer</h2>

<h4>I love distributed systems and config management.</h4>

<p>Using tools like Chef, Puppet, or CFEngine to automate large scale systems is so cool. I love that it&rsquo;s not just Google or Facebook that can create ridiculously fast and reliable infrastructures. A single admin can manage hundreds or even thousands of systems now with way less stress than we used to have to deal with.</p>

<h4>Excitement for trying new things.</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s very rare to find me not tinkering with some new gadget, tech, or tool. That passion is what helps me get more done than someone who feels it&rsquo;s just another job.</p>

<h4>Excellent problem solving and trouble shooting skills.</h4>

<p>In my first tech job as a consultant, I was responsible for developing effective solutions for clients to get their business back up and running as quickly as possible. Usually this meant going into a company I&rsquo;d never been in, talking to people I&rsquo;d never met, and working on systems I&rsquo;d never seen and then making everything come out good, fast, and cheap (because no one likes having to pick just two).</p>

<h4>Programming knowledge.</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming as a hobby since I was a teenager (TI-86 BASIC). My knowledge of Ruby, Python, Obj-C, and other languages keeps me from having to do the same thing over and over again and keeps me from being bored because there&rsquo;s an endless supply of things to learn.</p>

<h4>Excellent communication skills</h4>

<p>Often what people are asking for and what they&rsquo;re saying are two very different things (especially in tech). My years of experience as both a sysadmin and a consultant have heightened my ability to figure out what people are <em>really</em> asking for.</p>
