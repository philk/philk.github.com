What I Want
-----------
I'm looking for a company with a fanatical devotion to being awesome.  I want to work for a company that wants to do great things and do them incredibly well.

* * *

What I Offer
----------------

#### Excellent problem solving and trouble shooting skills.

In my first tech job as a consultant, I was responsible for developing effective solutions for clients to get their business back up and running as quickly as possible. Usually this meant going into a company I'd never been in, talking to people I'd never met, and working on systems I'd never seen and then making everything come out good, fast, and cheap (because no one likes having to pick just two).

#### Excitement for trying new things.

It's very rare to find me not tinkering with some new gadget, tech, or tool. That passion is what helps me get more done than someone who feels it's just another job.

#### Programming knowledge.

I've been programming as a hobby since I was a teenager (TI-86 BASIC). My knowledge of Ruby, Python, Obj-C, and other languages keeps me from having to do the same thing over and over again and keeps me from being bored because there's an endless supply of things to learn.

#### Extensive software knowledge.

I have used or set up numerous different configurations in my professional career including Microsoft Dynamics GP, MISYS, Quickbooks, Microsoft Office, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Asterisk, Apache, Nginx, MySQL, Tomcat, and many others. I've experimented with even more where I haven't yet had a need or chance to implement them in a professionally.

#### Excellent communication skills

Often what people are asking for and what they're saying are two very different things (especially in tech). My years of experience as both a sysadmin and a consultant have heightened my ability to figure out what people are _really_ asking for.

[LeapFILE](http://www.leapfile.com) is a large file transfer service. [Oxygen Cloud](http://oxygencloud.com) is a cloud storage startup. I came out in July of 2010 for a mid-level Technical Support position and used my sysadmin experience to work my way into an operations position.

* Setup and maintained Active Directory configuration using Group Policy for software installs and configuration.
* Maintained [Microsoft Dynamics GP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/products/gp-overview.aspx) system in spite of Microsoft's best attempts to destroy the data at every turn.
* Wrote numerous reports using SQL and/or Ruby to extract data from GP. I'm particularly proud of a recursive query using Common Table Expressions that I had to write because the built in Bill of Materials report was useless.
* Used Sinatra to work around various limitations in GP and provide better visibility into company data.
* Used Ruby to automate various processes that were manual in GP such as inventory cost rollups and catalog generation.

* Diagnosed end-user problems quickly and effectively. Pointed out when it was user error in the most polite manner possible or came up with workarounds for poorly written vertical market software packages (of which Point of Sale systems are the worst).
* Took stock of a each client's network and made recommendations to improve their productivity and reliability.
