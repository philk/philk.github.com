What I Want
-----------
I'm looking for a company with a fanatical devotion to being awesome.  I want to work for a company that wants to do great things and do them incredibly well.

* * *

What I Offer
----------------

#### I love distributed systems and config management.

Using tools like Chef, Puppet, or CFEngine to automate large scale systems is so cool. I love that it's not just Google or Facebook that can create ridiculously fast and reliable infrastructures. A single admin can manage hundreds or even thousands of systems now with way less stress than we used to have to deal with.

#### Excitement for trying new things.

It's very rare to find me not tinkering with some new gadget, tech, or tool. That passion is what helps me get more done than someone who feels it's just another job.

#### Excellent problem solving and trouble shooting skills.

In my first tech job as a consultant, I was responsible for developing effective solutions for clients to get their business back up and running as quickly as possible. Usually this meant going into a company I'd never been in, talking to people I'd never met, and working on systems I'd never seen and then making everything come out good, fast, and cheap (because no one likes having to pick just two).

#### Programming knowledge.

I've been programming as a hobby since I was a teenager (TI-86 BASIC). My knowledge of Ruby, Python, Obj-C, and other languages keeps me from having to do the same thing over and over again and keeps me from being bored because there's an endless supply of things to learn.

#### Excellent communication skills

Often what people are asking for and what they're saying are two very different things (especially in tech). My years of experience as both a sysadmin and a consultant have heightened my ability to figure out what people are _really_ asking for.

* Web Operations lead for a currently unannounced project based on Cloudkick technology.

### LeapFILE/Oxygen Cloud

[LeapFILE](http://www.leapfile.com) is a large file transfer service. [Oxygen Cloud](http://oxygencloud.com) is a cloud storage startup. I joined in July of 2010 for a mid-level Technical Support position and used my sysadmin experience to work my way into an operations position.

* Handled end-user product support for LeapFILE product while migrating legacy LeapFILE system to upgraded servers.
* Increased performance and system reliability by setting up Apache's mod_proxy_ajp to load balance between Tomcat backends.
* Set up monitoring and alerting using Cacti and Nagios.

* Maintained [Microsoft Dynamics GP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/products/gp-overview.aspx) system in spite of Microsoft's best attempts to destroy the data at every turn.
* Wrote numerous reports using SQL and/or Ruby to extract data from GP. I'm particularly proud of a recursive query using Common Table Expressions that I had to write because the built in Bill of Materials report was useless.
* Used Sinatra to work around various limitations in GP and provide better visibility into company data.
* Used Ruby to automate various processes that were manual in GP such as inventory cost rollups and catalog generation.

* Diagnosed end-user problems quickly and effectively. Pointed out when it was user error in the most polite manner possible or came up with workarounds for poorly written vertical market software packages (of which Point of Sale systems are the worst).
