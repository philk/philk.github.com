About Me
-----------

I'm a Systems Administrator / Ops Engineer / Tools Engineer / DevOps / whatever we're calling ourselves these days with more than 10 years experience across a ton of both terribly and wonderfully written systems. My mission is to work with a fun, passionate team to make products that people love. I love working with developers to build the tools and infrastructure they need to build, test, deploy, and debug awesome stuff as fast as humanly possible.

Experience

### Rackspace Hosting
Linux Systems Engineer II  
San Francisco, CA  
March 2011 - Present  

I joined [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com) very soon after their acquisition of [Cloudkick](http://cloudkick.com). I was brought on to help support the existing Cloudkick product as well as help set up Chef for future projects such as Cloud Monitoring and the Cloud Control Panel. I'm currently maintaining the Auto Scale product and working to make centralized logging available (via logstash and some other bits) to any team that wants it.

* Migrated Cloudkick infrastructure from Slicehost to Rackspace Cloud.
* Worked with developers to diagnose and eliminate bugs in Cloudkick, leading to reduced support load.
* Lead the initial setup of Chef/Vagrant images for developer and staging environments.
* Built out automation systems and infrastructure for Cloud Control Panel and Auto Scale projects.
* Designed and built centralizing logging infrastructure for multiple projects using Logstash and Elasticsearch.

### LeapFILE/Oxygen Cloud

Newark, CA  
July 2010 - March 2011  

[LeapFILE](http://www.leapfile.com) is a large file transfer service. [Oxygen Cloud](http://oxygencloud.com) is a cloud storage startup. I joined in July of 2010 for a mid-level Technical Support position and used my sysadmin experience to work my way into an operations position.

* Handled end-user product support for LeapFILE product while migrating legacy LeapFILE system to upgraded servers.
* Increased performance and system reliability by setting up Apache's mod_proxy_ajp to load balance between Tomcat backends.
* Set up monitoring and alerting using Cacti and Nagios.

* Wrote web based user signup process for Oxygen Cloud using Padrino (prototyped in Sinatra). Thrift APIs were used to communicate to the Java (Tomcat) backend service.

### Pressure-Pro, Inc

[Pressure-Pro](http://www.pressure-pro.com) is a pressure washer manufacturing company based in Fort Pierce, FL. I started this job to gain more experience working as an internal sysadmin for a mid-sized company.

* Helped end-users with day to day technical issues.
* Setup and maintained Active Directory configuration using Group Policy for software installs and configuration.
* Maintained [Microsoft Dynamics GP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/products/gp-overview.aspx) system in spite of Microsoft's best attempts to destroy the data at every turn.
* Wrote numerous reports using SQL and/or Ruby to extract data from GP.
* Used Sinatra to work around various limitations in GP and provide better visibility into company data.
* Used Ruby to automate various processes that were manual in GP such as inventory cost rollups and catalog generation.

### Stevens and Stevens

2001 - July 2006  
Jensen Beach, FL  

[Stevens and Stevens](http://stevensandstevens.com/) is a small computer consulting company operating out of the Jensen Beach, FL area. I started at this job while still in college and learned a huge amount rapidly.

* Setup new workstations by installing and configuring all required software. Often this included software I'd never seen before and had to learn the quirks of very quickly.
* Diagnosed end-user problems quickly and effectively. Pointed out when it was user error in the most polite manner possible or came up with workarounds for poorly written vertical market software packages (of which Point of Sale systems are the worst).
* Took stock of a each client's network and made recommendations to improve their productivity and reliability.
* Planned and implemented Active Directory setups for small-businesses becoming medium businesses.
* Planned server migrations to take place in the most effective manner possible to limit downtime.
